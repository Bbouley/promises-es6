# ES6 Promises

> The Promise object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

### Objectives
* Understand the basics of promises including state and chaining
* Make multiple async calls and return a single data structure, built up from the context of the other calls
* Successfully use `.then` and `.catch` to return results and errors
* Make parallel requests using `Promise.all`

To setup this project, simply run `npm install`. Then, follow the instructions in the `instructions` folder.
